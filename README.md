## Staff safety

Two 02 sensors are used, one in the root zone and another in the room. Unsafe oxygen levels are below 19.50% if this is detected the solonoid will be shut down to prevent anymore nitrogen being pumped into the envirment. at this point the only way for the system to start back up it to be phsically reset
oxygen alarms

if the oxygen in the room falls below 19.5% the alarm will sound alerty the staff of unsafe working conditions and to exit the room immediatly.
